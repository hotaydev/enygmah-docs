# Welcome to enygmah!

We trust you're doing well!

Currently, enygmah is still in development, and as a result, it's not available for download nor launch at this time.

Our scheduled launch date for the tool is set for the end of January 2024.

To keep yourself informed about the launch and receive other important updates, simply visit our [Github repository](https://github.com/hotaydev/enygmah) and click the *"Watch"* button. This feature allows you to customize your notifications, offering a fully flexible experience similar to a personalized newsletter. Rest assured, we'll utilize this method until our official newsletter is launched.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and expressing interest in enygmah. We operate as an entirely Open Source project and always welcome new contributors!
